javascript - Synchronous
             Single threaded
             (Default)

Execution Context - code execute line by line 
each operations wait until the last one complete it's executing

Blocking Code vs Non Blocking Code
blocking code are those which runs one by one it doesn't go to next line before executing the first
whereas the non blocking code is code which delegate the task to someone else and runs the code bellow it and returns it at the end.

javascript stanalone is a single threaded language but in browser it uses web api and in node environment node.js to create a context to run this delegated task and it return back in queue called callback queue and at the end it get runs in the code at the end


setTimeout() :- it is one of the function which is not the part of core javascript which means it delegate the task webapi

parameter (handler,timeout in milisecond)
handler is nothing but a call back function which execute after that many time

clearIntervel() :- if we want not to execute the setInterval task then we can use clearInterval
