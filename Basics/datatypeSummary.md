## Types of data type
There are only two types of data type one is **primitive** and another is **non-premitive or reference type**\
they are categorised by how these are stored in memory and how er gonna access them 

### Primitive (Call by value)
- (we have given the copy of that value not actual value)
- 7 types
  - number
  - string
  - boolean
  - null
  - undefined
  - symbol
  - bigInt

### Non Primitive (Reference type)
- we have given the access of memory in these
- function
- object
- array
